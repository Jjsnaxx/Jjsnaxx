I am a student with a huge interest in the CyberSecurity field, I am still extremely inexperienced but I hope to learn where ever I can!

## Objective

My career has largely revolved around the hospitality industry, I came across Hackthebox one day and it has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.

<h2>Cyber Security Projects:</h2>

- <b> Editing/Creating Firewall rules using Microsoft Windows Defender Firewall </b>
